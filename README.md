üö¶ Project Status & Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Known Issue
The current design of the student data structure requires manual updating of the student's class field every year (e.g., in the Edit form).

Problem: Student classes do not automatically increment at the end of the academic session (e.g., Class 6 should become Class 7).
Impact: Requires manual intervention by an administrator annually, risking data inaccuracies.

üêõ Other Known Issues
Component

Issue

Notes

ID Card Printing

Not Directly Printable

The component uses a mock function for useReactToPrint in the development environment. It only shows an alert message instead of opening the print dialog.

Student List

Verification Filter

The public /students route does not yet filter students by isVerified: true. Currently, all students are visible to logged-in users.

API Dependency

Server Required

The application is hard-coded to call server endpoints (e.g., VITE_SERVER_URL). A running backend API is mandatory for full functionality.

üõ†Ô∏è Required Improvements
These improvements are critical for transitioning the portal to production readiness:

1. Automated Class Roll-Over (HIGH PRIORITY)
Implement a background mechanism (or a scheduled admin action button) that iterates through all students and automatically increments their class level by one at the start of a new academic year. This should include logic for handling the transition out of the highest grade (e.g., Class 12).

2. Admin Verification Interface
Verification Button: Add a clear "Verify Student" button to the Admin Dashboard table view.

API Integration: Create the necessary API call (PUT request) to update the student's isVerified status in the database when the button is clicked.

3. Frontend Data Management
Auth State Persistence: Ensure the Admin/User authentication state persists correctly using local storage or secure cookies.

Form Validation: Implement robust client-side validation for all fields in the Registration form (e.g., DOB format, phone number length, required file uploads).

üîß Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v18+)
